# Homework #7

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

* Array

this is a series of objects of a similar data type which can be grouped together - in other words, a list.

think of it as a variable that can hold more than one piece of information at a time

simple example: if GAMER is our array title, objects in that array could be things like REAL NAME, CONSOLE USED, GAMER ID, HIGH SCORES, TROPHIES, RANKING, DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT ACTIVE, etc

this could then be turned into a matrix array by adding a second dimension (rows as well as columns) - in our GAMER example you could add all the different GAMES PLAYED by the GAMER - each game would have the details for each object in our simple example

then you would have an organised matrix of details about all the information, category by category. This is done by adding OBJECTS, KEY VALUES AND METHODS.

* Object

This is a software building block that can have information AND instructions in it

EG our HIGH SCORE is stored as 3987, but we just beat it, so the object HIGH SCORE now can have new information inside it to reflect a new HIGH SCORE of 5250. 

Our RANKING can go up to #8 and we are closer to receiving a better TROPHY.

---

* Method

This is a procedure (like a function) that is executed when an object receives a method. 

EG as we've beaten our HIGH SCORE and can be granted an EXTRALIFE, the method can be written to improve our RANKING.
